    <h2>About the Website</h2>
    <p class="text-medium">
      The aim of this website was to create a static, user-friendly site that serves as an archive explorer 
      for <strong>Freifunk's</strong> historical twitter social media posts. It includes a simple interface to 
      <strong>browse all tweets inverse chronologically</strong> (newest to oldest), and a
      <strong>search feature</strong> that lets you explore relevant tweets base on content and username. Lastly, it is designed to support additional social media archives in the future and is fully open source, allowing others to use this site as a template for their own archives.
